Road Accident Severity Analysis through Machine Learning Algorithms.

Research Question:
Does the geographical road condition and traffic affect accident severity? How do the weather, timing, and location affect accident severity? Can we classify the accident severity based on these parameters for Los Angeles County in California state for all types of vehicles through the past data from 2016 till the end of 2019?
